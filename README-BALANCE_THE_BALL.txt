# Balance the ball: 
is a simple control system implmented as a game between
two players who will try to balance the ball on the plate
using micro joy-sticks.
--------------------------
# The Arduino is used as a middle man to allow the sensors,
joystick, accelermoeter, and photosensor to communicate 
with each other. 
--------------------------
# The players can either use the joysticks to manipulate
the plate or use the photosensors. 
--------------------------
# This project is credit to Ramy from instructabels, but
has been modified and implemented by me.
